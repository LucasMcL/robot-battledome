## About
Robot Battledome is a simple game where you can fight robots.  In this game, every robot is either Rock, Paper, or Scissors type, and they each have strengths and weaknesses like you'd expect.  After going through the menus for selecting your robots, you enter the battledome.  Click the attack button as fast as your attack speed allows and try to defeat your opponent!

## Technologies Used
This project was completed using the jQuery and Bootstrap libraries.  It takes advantage of javascript's prototypal inheritance to generate randomized stats within ranges for each of the robots.
